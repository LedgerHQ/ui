            **The CI ran into issues while running the end to end tests.**

            Please check the [action page](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ui/actions/runs/${runId}) to find more details about the test run.

            You can download the \`test-run-data\` artifact at the bottom of the action page and replace the reference snapshots located at \`/tests/react.spec.js-snapshots\`.
